## Usage
The custom domain allows users to easily navigate to the web page at calebkitzman.com. Alias's have been set up to direct www.calebkitzman and the root page calebkitzman.com to the same underlying Azure web app. The original Azure url that the domains reference is located at black-cliff-048749210.1.azurestaticapps.net.

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Background photo should not duplicate the photos added. Needs to be fit correctly.
- Duplicate favorites when full screen on desktop. Should only show the 5 favorites.

To do:
- Add Google Maps API link to Des Moines, not New York
- Add PHP contact form, so emails go directly to me (unavailable on free template, need to pay or create my own)
